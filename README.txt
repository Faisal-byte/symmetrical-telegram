Project Name: The Queen's Gambit

Project Description:
This is a 3D-rendered chess program which allows you to play online or against an AI. 

Using the project: 
This project has 4 python files: main.py, ChessEngine.py, ChessAI.py, and ChatClient.py

In order to run this project successfully, only open the file main.py and run that on your editor. If you try to run any of the other three files mentioned above you will not load the project correctly. Additionally, this project uses the framework Pandas3D. You can install panda3d by typing "pip install panda3d==1.10.7" in you command prompt to install the package globally or locally in the same directory as this project. 

Other libraries that this project uses are: sockets, Tkinter, os and sys, all of which come pre-installed with Python. 

Once you run the main.py file, a Tkinter window will pop up with 2 buttons: "Play Online" and "Play Against AI". To play against the AI, you simply click the button, and after each game you complete with the AI, you have the option to play again, or to quit. If you click "Play Online" you will need to login, provided you have an account on the 15-122 server on 86.36.46.10.


RECOMMENDED: Using the escape key on your keyboard to exit the program is recommended over exiting by clicking the x button. 


Shortcuts:
If you are playing against the AI, you can undo moves up to 2 times consecutively  by clicking 'z' key

You can enable/disable automatically switching the camera for each player's turn by clicking 'x' key
